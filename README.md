# LLM Drugs (for Humans)

**[llmdrugs.com](https://llmdrugs.com)**

Short strings that shift your mental state — micro-doses for your brain, made of words.

256 doses of warmth, wonder, cosmic awe, and gentle perspective shifts. No dread. No scary. No accounts. No tracking. No server.

## Examples

> "Dogs dream about you."

> "Honey is sunlight stored in a jar."

> "Slow is still forward."

> "The night sky is old light arriving right on time."

> "A mistake is just data with feelings attached."

## How it works

One dose at a time. Pick a mood or let it surprise you. Each dose auto-advances after 8 seconds, or hit Next / Space / arrow keys. Share a dose, post it to X, or "dose someone" with a personalized link.

The entire thing is a single HTML file. No build step, no framework, no dependencies, no server. Just open `index.html`.

## Categories

| Category | Doses | Vibe |
|----------|-------|------|
| Warmth | 69 | Connection, comfort, quiet kindness |
| Wonder | 71 | Everyday magic, reframed objects |
| Cosmic | 58 | Stars, atoms, scale, deep time |
| Gentle Shift | 58 | Perspective nudges, reframes |

## Features

- **Single HTML file** — ~58KB, everything inline (CSS, JS, 256 doses)
- **Auto-advance** — loading bar fills over 8 seconds, then shows the next dose
- **Smooth crossfades** — per-element opacity/transform transitions between doses
- **Mood selector** — filter by Warmth, Wonder, Cosmic, Gentle Shift, or Surprise Me
- **Deep links** — `#/dose/dogs-dream` links directly to a specific dose
- **Dose someone** — personalized links like `#/for/Alex/honey-sun` that show "Alex, this one's for you"
- **Session counter** — tracks how many doses deep you are (milestones every 10)
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Space/Enter/Arrow/N for next, C to copy, Esc for mood selector
- **Share** — native share sheet, copy to clipboard, or post directly to X with the quote pre-filled
- **Particle background** — canvas-based ambient animation
- **No tracking** — no analytics, no cookies, no external requests (besides Google Fonts)

## Built with

This entire project — every line of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, every dose, every feature, every commit — was built through conversation with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) (Opus 4.6). The git history tells the story: from initial creation through redesign, naming iterations, viral features, share button debugging, and launch polish, all in a single extended session.
